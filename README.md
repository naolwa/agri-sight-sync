🌱 AgriAI: Intelligent Farming
AI-Powered Agricultural Intelligence for Sustainable Farming

AgriAI is an intelligent, data-driven platform designed to help farmers monitor soil health, plan crop rotations, and make smarter agricultural decisions using AI, IoT, and GIS technologies.

🚜 Problem Statement

Farmers face unpredictable soil health issues that lead to major crop losses.
Lack of reliable soil and environmental data prevents effective decision-making, especially in regions with limited access to precision farming tools.

🌾 Our Solution — AgriAI

AgriAI empowers farmers with real-time soil intelligence, AI-driven crop planning, and geospatial analysis to improve yield and promote sustainable practices.

Key Features
🧠 AI-Powered Soil Health Analysis

Analyzes soil moisture, pH, and nutrient levels using IoT sensors and uploaded soil images.

Provides personalized fertilization and irrigation recommendations.

Uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to detect imbalances and predict optimal soil treatment.

🌍 GIS Integration

ArcGIS REST API + Sentinel Hub + OpenWeather API integration.

Visualize:

Soil fertility, pH, and moisture maps

NDVI vegetation health

Land use and cover classification

Temperature and rainfall patterns

🧭 Interactive Map Viewer

Real-time soil and vegetation overlays

NDVI visualization for crop stress detection

Layer controls for soil moisture, rainfall, and land cover

Export maps and visual reports for analysis or sharing

🌿 Crop Rotation Planner

AI-powered rotation recommendations using ANN + rule-based logic

Suggests the next crop or rest period based on:

Soil nutrient balance (N, P, K)

Weather and disease risk

Current and historical crop performance

Stores recommendations in the cloud and displays them on a live dashboard

📊 Interactive Dashboard

Visualizes:

Soil nutrient trends

Crop rotation sequences

Land use and NDVI health charts

Built with Streamlit and Folium for real-time, interactive analytics
🛰️ Data Sources

ArcGIS REST API — Soil and land cover data

Sentinel Hub — NDVI and multispectral imagery

OpenWeather API — Temperature, rainfall, and climate data

Lovable Cloud — Real-time storage and analytics backend
